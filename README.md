# Famine Fighters
Final Project for CSS 385 at UW Bothell

## Part 1: Brainstorming 
Initially my group consisted of three people, none of us had any understanding of Unity. We started by sharing some of our favorite video games and trying to find ways to combine different aspects and mechaics of each game into a cohesive experience. 

After looking at demos from previous classes' final projects, we realized our ambitions might be too high and seemingly not achievable in the seven weeks we had. We reevaluated our ideas and decided to work with an asset pack we found on the Unity Asset Store (link below). The asset pack only contained sprites and no code or built animation sets. 

We decided on a 2D platformer that featured three of the four characters from the asset pack, with the fourth reserved as the final boss. The player would be given a choice at the beginning of the game of which character they wanted to play as, each with their own ability. The abilities are: double jump, dash, and gravity shift. 

Just before we gave our pitch, we came up with the idea to let the player switch between the characters in-game. The inspiration came from Grand Theft Auto 5 where the player is allowed to switch between its three characters each with their own abilities. This decision allowed us more flexibility with level design. 

Below is a link to the game pitch we gave:

After our pitch we had a new member join our team. This lessened the load of the work greatly. 

Below is a series of builds we presented to the class and our professor demonstrating the progress we made throughout the quarter. 
## Part 2: Prototypes
Our first task was determining what prototypes were necessary to create the game we wanted. 

Below is the first build that showcased some of the prototypes we initially decided on.

## Part 6: Final Play Through


## Difficulties and Known Problems
GitHub caused us problems as it didn't always merge scenes correctly. Initially we didn't know which files to push and this caused storage issues on GitHub. 

We used a tile map to construct the terrain which had its own specific collider component. We weren't able to fully figure out how to have the character sprite interact with this smoothly. For example, when the player interacts with a wall, the character shakes; and the wall will act as a floor if the player tries to jump next to it. We eventually determined that because we weren't using the character's RigidBody component to move the character, 

## Tools Used
To communicate we used Discord and iMessage. 
For file sharing we tried to use GitHub but found it tricky to work with and switched to Unity's collaboration tool. 

## Conclusion
I mainly worked on the hero behavior, animation, and physics. 

### Assets Used
Characters, enemies, traps, obstacles, items, and terrain were found on the Unity Asset Store.
